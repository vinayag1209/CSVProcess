1. Create Java POJO to hold relevant data. 
2. Class should contain fields for zipcode and zone

Create List of POJO that has  data loaded from csv/excel.

For each node in the list except last
Take first node - mark it as current
If!(min < max) and compare zones then
current.zip = min = max


check if next node has same value as current node for zone
If it does - max = next.zip 
	
else
create node
check if min=max -> zip = min	
	else zip = min:max
	zone  = current.zone
	
	add node to result list
	min = max = current.zip
	
End-for
If node[last].zip == maxzip do nothing
else 
zip = node[last].zip
zone = node[last].zone
Create node
Add to list


Write list to csv	
	
	
	
Process the new list - choose minimum zip and maximum zip. Concatentate the two with ":". 
Write this as a output NodeList.

Else
Write this node in output List 

Do this until end of list LOg
